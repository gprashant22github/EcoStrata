## Analysis Objective

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount. This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as income level in between census years. This information will help policymakers to better manage and avoid income inequality globally.

## Data Background

The dataset comprises information from approximately 200,000 individuals in the training set and about 100,000 individuals in the test set. The goal is to use this data to predict if an individual earns above 50,000 units of a specific currency. The key variables in the dataset include:

- Age
- Gender
- Education
- Class
- Education institute
- Marital status
- Race
- Hispanic origin
- Employment commitment
- Unemployment reason
- Employment state
- Wage per hour
- Labor union membership
- Working weeks per year
- Main industry code
- Main occupation code
- Total employed
- Household summary
- Under 18 family members
- Veteran benefits
- Tax status
- Gains
- Losses
- Stocks status
- Citizenship
- Residence 1 year ago
- Previous residence state
- Income above limit

Based on these variables, the analysis is assumed to be based on 20th-century American population data, where the median income was about $50,000.

## Why Predict Income?

Income prediction extracts insights from individual and population-level data, offering the ability to forecast income levels, assess financial risks, target marketing campaigns, and inform crucial decision-making in various fields. However, ethical considerations, potential biases, and data privacy concerns demand careful attention alongside its undeniable benefits.

## Importance in Public Policy

- **Predicting Tax Revenue**: Allocate government resources based on income distribution.
- **Social Assistance Programs**: Identify individuals in need of assistance based on income poverty.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing income inequality.
- **Progressive Taxation**: Design taxation systems based on predicted income levels.

## Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Leveraging machine learning to accurately predict income levels.
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be applied to large datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **Policy Support**: Provides insights to support public policy decisions.
